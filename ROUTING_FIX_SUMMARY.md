# Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The system had **multiple routing inconsistencies** that allowed users to access pages they shouldn't have access to:

1. **No centralized routing configuration** - routing logic was scattered across multiple files
2. **Inconsistent role checking** - each page had its own role check logic
3. **Hardcoded redirect paths** - embedded in multiple components
4. **Missing route protection** - some routes weren't properly protected
5. **Blocked roles could still login** - employee and other blocked roles could bypass restrictions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Centralized Routing Configuration (`frontend/src/lib/routes.ts`)

**Features:**
- All role definitions in one place
- Default page mapping for each role
- Route access control matrix
- Helper functions for role checking

**Key Functions:**
- `getDefaultPageForRole()` - Returns default page for a role
- `canAccessRoute()` - Checks if role can access a route
- `isAllowedRole()` - Validates if role is allowed
- `isBlockedRole()` - Validates if role is blocked

### 2. Updated Home Page (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Uses centralized routing configuration
- Properly handles blocked roles
- Redirects to login if role is not allowed

**Flow:**
```
User logs in → Check if role is allowed → Redirect to default page OR login
```

### 3. Enhanced ProtectedRoute (`frontend/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

**Improvements:**
- Checks blocked roles and redirects to login
- Uses centralized route access control
- Checks both route-specific and centralized allowedRoles
- Better error logging

### 4. Updated PublicRoute (`frontend/src/components/auth/PublicRoute.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Uses centralized routing for post-login redirect
- Properly handles all allowed roles
- Redirects blocked roles to login

## Role-Based Access Matrix

| Role | Default Page | Can Access Claims | Can Access Processor | Can Access RM | Can Access Profile |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| hospital_user | /claims | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| claim_processor | /processor-inbox | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| claim_processor_l4 | /processor-inbox | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| rm | /rm-inbox | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| reconciler | /rm-inbox | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| admin | /login (BLOCKED) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| employee | /login (BLOCKED) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| rp | /login (BLOCKED) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| hospital_admin | /login (BLOCKED) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Route Protection Summary

### Fully Protected Routes
- `/claims` - Only `hospital_user`
- `/drafts` - Only `hospital_user`
- `/claims-inbox` - Only `hospital_user`
- `/processor-inbox` - Only `claim_processor`, `claim_processor_l4`
- `/rm-inbox` - Only `rm`, `reconciler`
- `/profile` - All allowed roles

### Public Routes
- `/login` - Everyone (unauthenticated users)
- `/` (home) - Redirects based on role

## Benefits

1. **Security** - Blocked roles can't access the system
2. **Consistency** - All routing logic in one place
3. **Maintainability** - Easy to update role mappings
4. **Type Safety** - TypeScript ensures correct role usage
5. **Audit Trail** - Clear logging of access denials

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] hospital_user can access /claims, /drafts, /claims-inbox
- [ ] hospital_user CANNOT access /processor-inbox, /rm-inbox
- [ ] claim_processor can access /processor-inbox
- [ ] claim_processor CANNOT access /claims, /rm-inbox
- [ ] rm can access /rm-inbox
- [ ] rm CANNOT access /claims, /processor-inbox
- [ ] reconciler can access /rm-inbox
- [ ] reconciler CANNOT access /claims, /processor-inbox
- [ ] employee/blocked roles are redirected to /login
- [ ] All roles can access /profile

## Next Steps

1. Test each role's access with real users
2. Monitor logs for any access denied errors
3. Update documentation with role definitions
4. Consider adding more granular permissions if needed
