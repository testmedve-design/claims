# RM System - Complete Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

Built a complete **Relationship Manager (RM) System** for post-dispatch claim management, settlements, and reconciliation. This system continues the workflow after claims are processed by claim processors and dispatched to payers.

## üì¶ What Was Built

### Backend Components

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization (`/backend/middleware.py`)
**Changes Made**:
- Added `'rm'` to `ALLOWED_CLAIMS_ROLES` list
- Removed `'rm'` from `BLOCKED_ROLES` list
- Created `require_rm_access()` decorator function

**Features**:
- Role-based access control for RM users
- Extracts assigned payers from `entity_assignments.payers`
- Extracts assigned hospitals from `entity_assignments.hospitals`
- Validates RM role on every API request

#### 2. RM Routes (`/backend/routes/rm_routes.py`)
**New File Created** - 600+ lines of Python code

**5 API Endpoints**:

1. **GET /api/rm/get-claims**
   - Retrieves claims for RM inbox
   - Filters by assigned payer and hospital
   - Supports tabs: active, settled, all
   - Date range filtering
   - Returns claim list with RM status

2. **GET /api/rm/get-claim-details/<claim_id>**
   - Full claim details
   - Patient, payer, financial information
   - RM-specific data (rm_data)
   - Document list
   - Complete transaction history

3. **POST /api/rm/update-claim/<claim_id>**
   - Updates RM status
   - Saves settlement data for settlement statuses
   - Creates transaction record
   - Handles custom fields for other statuses

4. **POST /api/rm/reevaluate-claim/<claim_id>**
   - Marks claim for re-evaluation
   - Sets status to INPROGRESS
   - Records re-evaluation reason
   - Creates transaction entry

5. **GET /api/rm/get-rm-stats**
   - Returns statistics dashboard
   - Status-wise claim counts
   - Filtered by assigned entities

**RM Status Management**:
```python
RM_STATUSES = [
    'RECEIVED',
    'QUERY RAISED',
    'REPUDIATED',
    'SETTLED',
    'APPROVED',
    'PARTIALLY SETTLED',
    'RECONCILIATION',
    'INPROGRESS',
    'CANCELLED',
    'CLOSED',
    'NOT FOUND'
]

SETTLEMENT_STATUSES = ['SETTLED', 'PARTIALLY SETTLED', 'RECONCILIATION']
```

#### 3. App Integration (`/backend/app.py`)

- Imported `rm_bp` from `routes.rm_routes`
- Registered blueprint: `app.register_blueprint(rm_bp, url_prefix='/api/rm')`

## üîí Security Implementation

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

def get_rm_claims():
    # Only RM users can access
    pass
```

### 2. Entity-Based Filtering
```python
# In middleware:
request.assigned_payers = entity_assignments.get('payers', [])
request.assigned_hospitals = entity_assignments.get('hospitals', [])

# In routes:
# Filter claims by assigned entities automatically
```

### 3. Transaction Audit Trail
Every action creates a permanent record:
- Who performed the action
- When it was performed
- What changed (previous ‚Üí new status)
- Why (remarks)

## üì± Responsive Design

- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Responsive grid systems
- Collapsible forms on small screens
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Scrollable transaction history
