# 🔧 WSGI Module Debug Fix

## ✅ **Great Progress! Startup Script Working! 🎉**

The startup script is working perfectly:
```
🚀 Starting Hospital Claims Management System...
📍 Environment: production
🔧 Debug: false
🌐 Host: 0.0.0.0
🔌 Port: 10000
🚀 Starting Gunicorn server...
```

---

## ❌ **Current Issue:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wsgi'
```

**Root Cause**: Gunicorn can't find the `wsgi.py` file in the current working directory.

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Enhanced Startup Script with Debugging**
Updated `start.sh` to include:
- ✅ **Directory listing**: Shows current directory contents
- ✅ **File detection**: Checks if wsgi.py exists
- ✅ **Explicit binding**: Uses `--bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- ✅ **Debug output**: Clear logging for troubleshooting

### **2. Debug Information Added**
The script now shows:
```bash
📁 Current directory: $(pwd)
📄 Files in current directory:
ls -la
🔍 Looking for wsgi.py...
✅ Found wsgi.py (or ❌ wsgi.py not found)
```

---

## 🚀 **Deploy Again:**

### **Step 1: Push Changes**
```bash
git add start.sh
git commit -m "Add debugging to startup script for WSGI module issue"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Redeploy on Render**
1. Go to your Render service
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
3. Check the debug output to see what's happening

---

## 🎯 **Expected Debug Output:**

After redeployment, you should see:
```
🚀 Starting Hospital Claims Management System...
📍 Environment: production
🔧 Debug: false
🌐 Host: 0.0.0.0
🔌 Port: 10000
🚀 Starting Gunicorn server...
📁 Current directory: /opt/render/project/src
📄 Files in current directory:
[list of files]
🔍 Looking for wsgi.py...
✅ Found wsgi.py
```

---

## 🔍 **Possible Solutions Based on Debug Output:**

### **If wsgi.py is found:**
- The issue might be Python path related
- We may need to adjust the import in wsgi.py

### **If wsgi.py is not found:**
- The file might not be in the root directory
- We may need to adjust the working directory

### **If directory structure is different:**
- We may need to adjust the startup script path

## 📋 **What This Debugging Will Show:**

✅ **Current Directory**: Where the script is running  
✅ **File List**: What files are available  
✅ **WSGI File**: Whether wsgi.py exists  
✅ **Path Issues**: Any import problems  

---

**Status**: ✅ **DEBUGGING ADDED - Ready for diagnosis**  
**Next Step**: ✅ **Deploy and check debug output**
