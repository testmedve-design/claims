# 🔧 Render Deployment Fix

## ❌ **Issue Identified:**
```
ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Created Root Requirements File**
Created `requirements.txt` in the root directory that references backend requirements:
```txt
# Hospital Claims Management System - Root Requirements
# This file points to the backend requirements for Render deployment

# Install backend requirements
-r backend/requirements.txt
```

### **2. Updated render.yaml**
Changed build command from:
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```
To:
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 **Deploy Again:**

### **Step 1: Push Changes**
```bash
git add requirements.txt render.yaml
git commit -m "Fix Render deployment - add root requirements.txt"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Redeploy on Render**
1. Go to your Render service
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
3. Or delete and recreate the service

---

## 📋 **What This Fixes:**

✅ **Requirements File**: Render can now find `requirements.txt` in root  
✅ **Dependencies**: All backend dependencies will be installed  
✅ **Gunicorn**: Production WSGI server will work  
✅ **Flask App**: Application will start correctly  

---

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

After redeployment, you should see:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Gunicorn starting
- ✅ Flask app running
- ✅ Health check working

---

## 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

### **Alternative Solution:**
If the above doesn't work, you can also:

1. **Copy requirements to root:**
```bash
cp backend/requirements.txt requirements.txt
```

2. **Or use absolute path in render.yaml:**
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r ./backend/requirements.txt
```

---

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - Ready for redeployment**
