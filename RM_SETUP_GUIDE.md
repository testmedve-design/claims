```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Create an RM User in Firestore

Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí `users` collection

Create a new document with this structure:

```json
{
  "uid": "rm_user_123",
  "email": "rm@example.com",
  "role": "rm",
  "displayName": "RM User Name",
  "entity_assignments": {
    "payers": [
      {
        "id": "payer_1",
        "name": "Star Health Insurance"
      },
      {
        "id": "payer_2",
        "name": "HDFC Ergo"
      }
    ],
    "hospitals": [
      {
        "id": "hospital_1",
        "name": "Apollo Hospital",
        "code": "APL001"
      },
      {
        "id": "hospital_2",
        "name": "Fortis Hospital",
        "code": "FOR002"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Create a Test Claim

In Firestore ‚Üí `claims` collection:

```json
{
  "claim_id": "CLM_TEST_001",
  "claim_status": "dispatched",
  "rm_status": "RECEIVED",
  "hospital_id": "hospital_1",
  "hospital_name": "Apollo Hospital",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "submission_date": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "form_data": {
    "payer_name": "Star Health Insurance",
    "patient_name": "John Doe",
    "age": 45,
    "gender": "Male",
    "claimed_amount": 150000,
    "total_bill_amount": 150000
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Login and Test

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with the RM user credentials
3. You'll be redirected to `/rm-inbox`
4. You should see the test claim
